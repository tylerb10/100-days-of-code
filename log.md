# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "comments" button on the Twimba twitter clone on Scrimba on the Essential Javascript concepts module.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with using forEach() to loop through arrays (trying to separate them from for loops that I've done before).


### Day 2: June 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added the ability to "tweet" in Twimba, using unshift to add an object to the beginning of an array.

**Thoughts:** Going to work on adding the ability to comment on a tweet tomorrow to tweak the project a bit.


### Day 3: June 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a modal popup, hopefully opening when clicking the comment button. 

**Thoughts:** Started with thinking of using a prompt or alert for this function, but wanted to control more of the appearance with CSS. 


### Day 4: June 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked up a modal using a div and display properties forcing it to not display, then found out about the dialog element. 

**Thoughts:** Nothing today. 


### Day 5: June 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my modal for the Twitter clone. I have it popping up on the correct button push, and can close it. I want it to also close when clicking outside of the modal, and I cannot figure out how to center it vertically on the page when it pops up. A problem for tomorrow!


### Day 6: June 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Used some CSS positioning to center my modal on the screen, and made sure that closing it would also reset the text area. Plan for tomorrow is to get that reply to actually show up at the top the the reply feed!


### Day 7: June 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of progress today, just doing a lot of research on different methods to render a reply. Also trying to decide on the layout for the reply button.


### Day 8: June 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I think I have the function written out correctly, and added a button for replying to a tweet. Still struggling to get the "Tweet Reply" button to actually render a reply at the top of the feed. 


### Day 9: June 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Currently getting some help from the Scrimba discord on why half of my function is not behaving the way I intended. Doing a lot of code refactoring, but I really want this feature to work!


### Day 10: June 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Still can't get the reply to render the way I want, so I am going to take a break from this feature and start working on the food ordering solo project!


### Day 11: June 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML organization for a food ordering mobile site. Just getting the basic skeleton down before moving a lot of it to the JS to make it more dynamic with adding additional items. 


### Day 12: June 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created an external data sheet and linked it to index.js for various menu items. Sticking with a restaurant theme for now, but might switch it up once the app is up and running.


### Day 13: July 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Working on creating a feed for the online ordering app, hopefully easy to update with new stuff as an array of objects.
 

### Day 14: July 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent time working on loops using forEach() and got my feed rendering correctly. Started to work with the CSS to make things look a little bit better, and I think this is my favorite part of projects.


### Day 15: July 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: More layout work using flexbox. Looking for stock images for the header as well, but am having a hard time sizing them correctly for the header element... 


### Day 16: July 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Played around with some tools for making images more useful within a specific layout. I am really liking resizing.app


### Day 17: July 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Working on getting the "cart" to function in my restaurant ordering app. Getting the HTML sorted, then I need to figure out how to link the menu item that gets clicked on to render correctly in the cart section.


### Day 18: July 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time going over data attributes and how I can use them in my ordering app. 


### Day 19: July 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Writing functions to add clicked on menu items to a different array in my food ordering app. Also looking at how I want those to render in a new section below the menu after you add it to your order.
