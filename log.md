# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "comments" button on the Twimba twitter clone on Scrimba on the Essential Javascript concepts module.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with using forEach() to loop through arrays (trying to separate them from for loops that I've done before).

### Day 2: June 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added the ability to "tweet" in Twimba, using unshift to add an object to the beginning of an array.

**Thoughts:** Going to work on adding the ability to comment on a tweet tomorrow to tweak the project a bit.

### Day 3: June 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a modal popup, hopefully opening when clicking the comment button. 

**Thoughts:** Started with thinking of using a prompt or alert for this function, but wanted to control more of the appearance with CSS.
